Update history:

04/29/2018 uniConSig version 2.0
1. New function: uniConSig.preCal Change of the calculation strategy avoids the repeated calculation of penalization 
   factors and Effective Concept Number, which reduces the calculation time to less than 2 minutes(using Perl version).
   This new function will take the concept matrix as input, and output a file containing the required factors for each gene.
2. Change of function: uniConSig.main This function will substitute the previous function "uniConSig". This function
   will take use of the factors calculated by "uniConSig.preCal" and the input gene list to calculate uniConSig scores.
3. New files: will include the perl scripts.
